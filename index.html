                <h2>LONDON</h2>
                <p>
                    As the “capital of capitals”—still 
                    waist-deep in an opaque pandemic 
                    slurry—negotiates the uncharted, 
                    perilous terrain of a post-Brexit 
                    world, London continues to reign 
                    the planet’s best cities for the 
                    sixth year running. Its position 
                    at the top, however, 
                    has never been more tenuous.

                <h2>PARIS</h2>
                <p>
                    Paris attacked the pandemic not only 
                    with its doctors and health-care 
                    workers, but also with its urban 
                    planners. For all the talk of learning 
                    from the pandemic, one city appears to 
                    be going all-in on the hard lessons it 
                    gave and their application to 
                    molecular urban change.

                <h2>NEW YORK</h2>
                <p>
                    If New York City forgot about how 
                    bad life can get for its citizenry
                    , the past 18 months were a hellish 
                    reminder. The greatest city in 
                    America—lauded and crowned in our 
                    ranking for the past six years and 
                    in countless others for many more—was 
                    a ghastly reminder during the pandemic.

                <h2>DUBAI</h2>
                <p>
                    An alluring blend of over-the-top 
                    experiences, Arab heritage and luxury 
                    shopping, Dubai is so over the pandemic. 
                    Dubai is a city of superlatives: you 
                    can ride the elevator to the top of 
                    the world ’s tallest building for a 
                    bird’s-eye view, bet on the 
                    ponies at the world’s richest.
